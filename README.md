Important considerations - 

Do not change the heading labels in any of the csvs 

You can add different for cols other calculations, and change trucks etc, but pls make sure to delete all white spaces from the WHOLE csv sheet otherwise it will cause errors. 

Worst case scenario, pls utilise the csv files from here (stored in data folder)
